features
* Fire Emblem Heroes:
  * extensive and expandable model for the entire Fire Emblem Heroes game
  * hero, skill, and refine data
  * hero constructor (apply skills, assets/flaws, merges, dragonflowers, etc. to generate their prospective stats)
  * unit comparisons (5* lv40 only, 4/15/20)
* specialized tools for various STEM subjects:
  * math (basic calculations, function minima, matrices)
  * chemistry (element factsheets, chemical equation balancing, molar mass, periodic table trends)
  * physics (rudimentary object-oriented physics models; non-user facing)
  * unit converter: convert quantities from one unit to the other
    * units are combinable (kg-m^2/s^2 and ft-lb are valid, derived from their base units)
    * customizable: custom units can be registered in terms of preexisting units with their own name, symbol, and scale
  * why are those red idk what's going on
* other basic discord bot crap
  * roll
  * chances (percentage "chance" version of roll)
  * games (tic-tac-toe, flow)
planned
* Fire Emblem Heroes:
  * turn expandable model into complete model
  * persistent barracks with mechanically accurate and interactable units
  * accurate gameplay
  * replicated game AI (since i wouldn't have many people to play with)
  * license so that i don't get struck down
* STEM:
  * custom unit persistence (maybe with some per-server stuff)
  * redox reactions
  * better chemistry utils in general
  * more advanced math, maybe interact with some already well-developed api rather than doing really crumby stuff on my own
* a whole host of other stuff
