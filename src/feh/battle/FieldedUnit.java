    // not-so-obvious replacing.
    // this is mostly related to SP and HM, since the Unit instance the
    // FieldedUnit is based off of must replace the one sitting in the barracks;
    // they are different objects.

    // the barracks store FieldedUnits (that are casted naturally to Unit)
    // constantly, and simply reset the properties of the FieldedUnit at
    // deployment.
    // this would require non-final fields for relatively final stuff:
    //      blessing bonuses
